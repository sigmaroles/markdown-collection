Integrate it with the concept of "most of wealth in modern finance is an accounting trick"

Here is a fact most of you don’t understand. Stablecoins are a tool to infinitely trap liquidity into treasuries without an exit. Most stablecoins don’t return to USD. It is the 18th largest excess liquidity sink on the planet, and growing.

> You are absolutely correct, I do not understand this

>> The economy is a bath tub, the printer is a faucet. Their needs to be a sink to prevent the water from being stagnant or overflowing. Oil used to be the OG sink, but that era is ending. New sinks need to come online to keep the faucet running

>>> Thank you for the explanation! 
From what I understand, with the faucet on, overflowing bathtub implies hyperinflation like scenario?
What's the problem with keeping the water stagnant and turning off the faucet? 
Alternatively - why need a sink and not turn off the faucet?

> That’s absolutely correct
Also in the absence of accurate underlying audits, the best way to get all the benefits of CDOs and still say “this time it’s different”. 

>> Nobody understands crypto and how it’s used by governments to keep printing. Crypto is a midwit hated thing. Dumb politicians love it. Mids hate it. 130 IQ deep state politicians adore it

>>> Liquidity sink. Also magical because you can regulate it out of existence and rebalance your monetary mass. The equivalent of burning tokens. The opposite of defence  spending.

> Stablecoins as an infinite liquidity trap is a wild but accurate take. They're locking up capital in treasuries without the need to ever exit back to USD—essentially creating a liquidity vortex. The more it grows, the more control slips away from traditional financial systems.

>> No one understands why they don’t go after Tether. Because none of you understand how the deep financial apparatus works

> I think you're right and this is very good for USA.What's your opinion on how it affects the rest of the world and Bitcoin?

>> Trojan horse, the 130 IQ financiers are falling into a trap and I’m here for it

Certainly! Let's break down each of these statements to make them clear and understandable, keeping all the original ideas intact. I'll use analogies and explanations relevant to fields like acoustics or theoretical computer science to bridge the gap between finance and your area of expertise.

### **1. Stablecoins Trap Liquidity into Treasuries Without an Exit**

**Explanation:**
Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar (USD). Imagine them as digital versions of dollars that exist on the blockchain. When people use stablecoins, they often deposit them into financial products or treasuries, which are essentially investment vehicles managed by institutions like banks or crypto platforms.

**Analogy:**
Think of liquidity (money available for use) as sound energy in a room. When you trap liquidity into treasuries, it's like sound being absorbed into materials, making it harder for it to bounce back into the room (i.e., be used elsewhere).

### **2. Most Stablecoins Don’t Return to USD**

**Explanation:**
While stablecoins are supposed to maintain parity with the USD, in reality, many do not effectively do so. This means that if you expect 1 stablecoin to always be equivalent to $1, it sometimes fails to maintain that value.

**Analogy:**
Imagine expecting a particular frequency of sound to remain constant, but due to interference, the pitch fluctuates unpredictably.

### **3. 18th Largest Excess Liquidity Sink on the Planet, and Growing**

**Explanation:**
A "liquidity sink" refers to a place where money accumulates and is not easily accessible for other uses. Being the 18th largest implies that stablecoins are a significant global destination for excess money, and this trend is increasing.

**Analogy:**
Consider excess computational resources in a data center that are allocated to a single server, making them unavailable for other tasks. Stablecoins are like that server, absorbing more resources over time.

### **4. No Accurate Underlying Audits; Benefits of CDOs with “This Time It’s Different”**

**Explanation:**
Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) are financial instruments that pool various types of debt and sell them to investors. The statement suggests that stablecoins lack thorough audits (verifications of their financial health) but still offer the benefits of complex financial products like CDOs, while claiming improvements or differences from past issues.

**Analogy:**
It's like using a complex algorithm without fully testing its components, yet claiming it works flawlessly every time.

### **5. Governments Use Crypto to Keep Printing Money**

**Explanation:**
Governments can utilize cryptocurrencies as a tool to continue expanding their money supply, similar to how they "print" more money. This can lead to inflation or devaluation of the currency.

**Analogy:**
Imagine continuously adding more data to a storage system without increasing its capacity, leading to slower performance and potential data loss.

### **6. Crypto is a Midwit Hated Thing**

**Explanation:**
"Midwit" is a slang term referring to someone with average intelligence. The statement suggests that average people dislike cryptocurrency.

**Analogy:**
Think of a specialized tool that only experts appreciate, while average users find it confusing or unappealing.

### **7. Dumb Politicians Love It; Mids Hate It; >130 IQ Deep State Politicians Adore It**

**Explanation:**
This divisive statement categorizes supporters of cryptocurrency based on perceived intelligence levels:
- Politicians considered less intelligent ("dumb") are enthusiastic about crypto.
- Average individuals ("mids") dislike it.
- Highly intelligent or strategically minded politicians ("deep state" with >130 IQ) also support it.

**Analogy:**
It's like a complex programming language favored by both novice coders for its simplicity and expert programmers for its power, while the average user finds it inaccessible.

### **8. Liquidity Sink; Can Regulate It Out of Existence and Rebalance Monetary Mass**

**Explanation:**
A liquidity sink absorbs money, and authorities can potentially control or eliminate it through regulations. This allows them to adjust the overall money supply or "monetary mass" in the economy.

**Analogy:**
Think of a network bandwidth limit that can be adjusted or shut down, controlling how much data flows through and redistributing resources as needed.

### **9. Equivalent of Burning Tokens**

**Explanation:**
"Burning tokens" refers to the process of permanently removing cryptocurrency tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply. This can be used to manage value or control inflation within the crypto ecosystem.

**Analogy:**
It's similar to deleting files from a computer to free up space, ensuring that storage is managed effectively.

### **10. The Opposite of Defense Spending**

**Explanation:**
Defense spending involves allocating resources (money) to military and protective measures. The opposite would mean reducing resource allocation in a particular area, possibly reallocating funds elsewhere.

**Analogy:**
If defense spending is like dedicating processing power to security software on a computer, the opposite would be reducing that power, freeing it up for other applications.

### **Summary**

In essence, the statements express a critical view of stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They suggest that stablecoins lock up significant amounts of money in ways that aren't transparent or reliable, akin to trapping energy or data in one part of a system. The narrative also touches on the political dynamics surrounding crypto, implying that different groups support it for varying, often strategic, reasons. Additionally, there's an emphasis on the potential for regulation to control or eliminate the impact of cryptocurrencies, much like managing resources in technical systems.

Understanding these ideas involves recognizing stablecoins' role in financial systems, their potential risks due to lack of transparency, and the complex interplay between technology, economics, and politics that shapes the cryptocurrency landscape.
